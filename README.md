## Text Classification with BERT and Neural Networks
### Summary of Work Completed: Text Classification with BERT and Neural Networks
#### 1. BERT-based Text Classification Model:
I have implemented a text classification pipeline using BERT for sentiment analysis (or any other classification task). The key steps involved:
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the text data by removing special characters, URLs, and stopwords.
* BERT Tokenization: Tokenized the cleaned text using BERT's tokenizer, ensuring the input is formatted correctly for BERT.
* Model Training: Fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT model on the labeled training data for classification.
* Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy on the test set, validating the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
* Inference: Implemented a prediction pipeline to classify new, unseen text data using the trained BERT model. This BERT-based model leverages transfer learning, taking advantage of BERT's deep contextual understanding to provide state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks.

#### 2. Neural Network-based Text Classification Model:
In parallel, I developed a Neural Network (NN)-based model for the same classification task. The process included:
* Data Preprocessing: Similar text cleaning steps were applied, including tokenization and removal of irrelevant characters.
* Model Architecture: Built a neural network using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, which are suitable for sequence data like text.
* Training: The neural network was trained with labeled data, optimizing weights using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
* Evaluation: The model was evaluated on a test set, providing a benchmark for comparison with the BERT model.
* Inference: Deployed the NN model for making predictions on new text inputs. The NN-based model, while more basic compared to BERT, performed well on the classification task and is more lightweight, making it suitable for environments where computational resources are constrained.
  
##### Conclusion:
Both models have been successfully implemented for text classification tasks, with the BERT-based model providing superior performance due to its deep contextual embeddings. The Neural Network model, though less advanced, offers a simpler and more computationally efficient solution. Both models are suitable for real-time text classification applications depending on the resource constraints and performance requirements.
